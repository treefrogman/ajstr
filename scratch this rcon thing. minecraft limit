scratch this rcon thing. minecraft limits the command length through rcon.
just wrap the java server in a go server with an exec command.
in the go server create a websocket so the frontend gets all the output.
that way we can send commands to our frontend from within minecraft.
let's say we choose our own prefix like #
then the frontend watches for lines beginning with # and parses them as commands
